For example, you might have a toy car, a toy airplane, and a toy robot. Each of these toys is a little bit different, but they all have some things in common. For example, they might all have wheels or they might all be able to move around. This is OOP because each toy is like its own "object" and they all have the same things (like wheels or movement) because they are part of the same "class" (toys). So when you want to make your toys do something, you can just tell them what to do and they\'ll do it because they all have the same abilities.
